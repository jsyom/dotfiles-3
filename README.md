## Installation
#### Clone this repo
First step, clone the dotfiles repository to your computer. This can be placed anywhere, and symbolic links will be created to reference it from your home directory.
``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jsyom/dotfiles-3.git ~/.dotfiles
$ cd ~/.dotfiles
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

#### Symlink
Every file with a `.symlink` extension will be symlinked to the `~/` home directory with a `.` in front of it. For example, [`vimrc.symlink`](vim/vimrc.symlink) will be symlinked in the home directory as `~/.vimrc`. Additionally, all files in the `$DOTFILES/config` directory will be symlinked to the `~/.config/` directory for applications that follow the XDG base directory specification, such as neovim.
``` bash
$ source ./install/link.sh
```

#### Install Homebrew formulae
Install homebrew if it is not currently installed, then install the homebrew packages listed in [`brew.sh`](install/brew.sh).
```bash
$ source ./install/brew.sh
```

#### Install native apps
Use brew cask to install native apps listed in [`brew-cask.sh`](install/brew-cask.sh).
```bash
$ source ./install/brew-cask.sh
```


## Local/Private configuration
Any private and custom commands and configuration should be placed in a `~/.localrc` file. This file will not be under version control or committed to a public repository. If `~/.localrc` exists, it will be sourced for the inclusion of [`.zshrc`](zsh/zshrc.symlink).

Here is an example `~/.localrc`:
```bash
# Git credentials
# Not under version control to prevent people from accidentally committing with your details
GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="John Yom"
GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="email@example.com"
GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
# Set the credentials (modifies ~/.gitconfig)
git config --global user.name "$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
git config --global user.email "$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"

# Aliases
alias s="cd ~/Sites"
alias p="cd ~/Projects"
```


## Tmux
Install tmux plugins with [tpm](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) by pressing `prefix + I`.

This will install the plugins listed in [`.tmux.conf`](https://github.com/epilande/dotfiles/blob/master/tmux/tmux.conf.symlink#L132).


## Neovim
#### Install plugins
Vim plugins are managed by [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), when opening vim for the first time run:
```bash
$ nvim +PlugInstall
```

##### Nerd fonts for vim-devicons
If you're seeing boxes `□`, this means your current font does not support
powerline and nerd fonts. Install [nerd-fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts#font-installation) and configure your gui/terminal, in my case iTerm, to use a patched font for non-ascii characters. If you prefer not to do this, then simply remove the `Plug 'ryanoasis/vim-devicons'` plugin from [`plugins.vim`](vim/vim.symlink/plugins.vim).

My default font is currently `Monaco`, and for non-ascii characters I'm using `Droid Sans Mono Nerd Font`.


### Node packages
```bash
$ npm install -g instant-markdown-d jsonlint prettier
```
